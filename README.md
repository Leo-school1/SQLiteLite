# SQLiteLite
A database designed after SQLite made in C. Not made using SQL or SQLite, but partially based on SQLite syntax. Coded in pure C with no external libraries. This project is for learning purposes, as such I would not recommend using for real databases. Feel free to use the code if you want to make a similar project or something else.

## Compile
Compile using CMake with the following commands:

```mkdir build```

```cd build```

```cmake ..```

```cmake --build .```

```SQLiteLite.exe``` will be located in the ```build``` directory. You can find it in there or run it in your terminal with 
```./Debug/SQLiteLite.exe ```(from the ```build``` directory.)
