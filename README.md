# SQLiteLite
A database designed after SQLite made in C. Not made using SQL or SQLite, just pure C. This project is for my learning purposes, as such I may not change features quickly if asked, but I will try to get around to it. Feel free to use it if you want.

## Compile
Compile using CMake with the following commands:

```mkdir build```

```cd build```

```cmake ..```

```cmake --build .```

```SQLiteLite.exe``` will be located in the ```build``` directory. You can find it in there or run it in your terminal with 
```./Debug/SQLiteLite.exe ```(from the ```build``` directory.)
